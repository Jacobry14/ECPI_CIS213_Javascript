# ECPI_Javascript

The follow files are assignments I've worked on from my CIS213 Javascript class durring my time at ECPI.

Examples of what I've worked on are a pop up windown once a button is clicked, a string that displays the current date/time, a message of your last visit from using cookies,
    and a restaurant tiping calculator.
